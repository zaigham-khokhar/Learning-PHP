    // For Loop in PHP
    /* For loop is a control structure that allows you to execute a block of code a 
    specified number of times. 
    The syntax for a for loop is as follows:
        for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
            // code to be executed
        }
    */
    // Example of a for loop that prints the numbers from 1 to 10
    
    for ($i = 1; $i <= 10; $i++) {
        echo $i . "\n <br>";
    }
