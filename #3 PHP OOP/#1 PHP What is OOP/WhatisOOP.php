    // Let's Learn About PHP OOP.
    /* In PHP, OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.
    PHP OOP is about organizing code into classes and objects that have properties and methods.
    PHP OOP is ideal for building scalable, reusable, and maintainable code.
    Traditional procedural programming follows a step-by-step approach and will execute the
    commands sequentially, while object-oriented programming is about creating classes and
    objects, and decide how they will interact.
 
    Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:

    OOP is faster and easier to execute
    OOP provides a clear structure for the program
    OOP helps to keep the code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to
    maintain, modify and debug
    OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter
    development time
    Tip: The "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle is about reducing the repetition of code.
    You should extract out the codes that are common for the application, and place them
    at a single place and reuse them instead of repeating it.
    PHP OOP helps create modular, reusable, and maintainable code by using:
